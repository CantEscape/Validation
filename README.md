# CantEscape / Validation
A new community-driven validation API in PHP

### What I'd like to do
This is something I pretty much overnight while my newborn couldn't sleep and figured that I may as well share it here, if you'd like to contribute whether it's to the application itself or the validators rules any and all input is welcome through a pull request

### Installation
By Composer,
```composer require cantescape/validation @dev```

### Getting Started
See the Wiki
