# CantEscape / Validation
A new community-driven validation API in PHP

### What I'd like to do
This is something I pretty much overnight while my newborn couldn't sleep and figured that I may as well share it here, if you'd like to contribute whether it's to the application itself or the validators rules any and all input is welcome through a pull request

### Installation
CantEscape Validation will be available shortly via Composer, for the moment though it's all here.
